### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Daniel, current chemistry PhD student at the [Vogt Lab](https://charlottevogtlab.net.technion.ac.il).

My work revolves around the (electro)conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into other valuable products by employing spectroscopic methodologies. To this end, IÂ´m currently working on developing methodologies to analyze (mainly) large time-series datasets. If you are interested in collaborating in any way, feel free to contact me!
